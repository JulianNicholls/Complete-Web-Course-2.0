# Rob Percival's Complete Web Course 2.0

This is my code from Rob Percival's
[The Complete Web Developer Course 2.0](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-course-2).

## Progress

Working on section 14 - Twitter Clone.

## Differences from Rob Percival

I have probably skipped large sections, notably the Twitter API lectures because I couldn't be bothered to wait for the apparently lengthy approval process to become a Twitter deveoper now.

I am not using jQuery in the Twitter Clone, it is still loaded though, because parts of Bootstrap require it.

## Git client

I have used Git at the command-line for 10 years.
Over that time, I have tried many different graphical shells for Git,
without finding one that was easier and nicer to use than the command-line
(in my view).

I have now found that [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) is an excellent
Git shell and would advise using it to everyone.
